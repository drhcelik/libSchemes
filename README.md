# Modified Numerical Schemes for OpenFOAM (libSchemes)

- **GammaM is a differencing scheme for eddy-resolving approaches (DDES,IDDES,LES), based on Gamma scheme.**
- **filteredLinearM is a differencing scheme for eddy resolving approaches (DDES,IDDES,LES), based on filteredLinear scheme.**
- **Koren is a differencing scheme for sufficiently data.**
