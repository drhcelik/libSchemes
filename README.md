**Modified Differencing Schemes for OpenFOAM**

- **GammaM** is a differencing scheme for eddy-resolving approaches (DDES,IDDES,LES), based on Gamma scheme.
- **filteredLinearM** is a differencing scheme for eddy-resolving approaches (DDES,IDDES,LES), based on filteredLinear scheme.
- **Koren** is a differencing scheme (flux limiter) for sufficiently data.

The library supports both OpenFOAM branches (v6.0 and v1812 or earlier).
