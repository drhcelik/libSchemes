**Modified Differencing Schemes for OpenFOAM**

- **GammaM** is a differencing scheme for eddy-resolving approaches (DDES,IDDES,LES), based on Gamma scheme. In the modified GammaM scheme there are two free parameters: γ and δ. The proposed GammaM scheme correctly describes the transfer of energy from large vortices to small ones at Cs = 0.15 and is stable at the values of the free parameters  γ=0.1, δ=[0.8,0.9]. Example for use:
GammaM 0.1 0.9
- **filteredLinearM** is a differencing scheme for eddy-resolving approaches (DDES,IDDES,LES), based on filteredLinear scheme. In the modified filteredLinearM scheme, there are two free parameters α and β. The proposed filteredLinearM scheme at the values of the free parameters of α = 1 and β=[0.85,0.9] and Smagorinsky’s constant of Cs = 0.15 correctly describes the energy spectrum and is more stable than its original implementation. Example for use:
> filteredLinearM 1 0.85
- **Koren** is a differencing scheme (flux limiter) for sufficiently data.

The library supports both OpenFOAM branches (v6.0 and v1812 or earlier).
